The code is the demo of the proposed algrithms (FALRSTS-1 and FALRSTS-2) in the paper "Fast and accurate traffic data recovery based on low-rankness and spatio-temporal smoothness".

FALRSTS: the algorithm presented as Algorithm 1 in the paper.
FALRSTS_fast: FALRSTS plus an additional convergence criterion.
FALRSTS_demo: select all the code and run it.
